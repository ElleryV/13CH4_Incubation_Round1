# 13CH4 Incubation Round1

## Overview
Repository for data processing and analysis related to my first 13CH4 incubation, including the initial pH manipulation experiment and follow up water addition experiment

## Guide to scripts in this repository

***Data wrangling*** *(scripts used to clean, organize, and prep data for statistical analysis):* 

1. **placeholder** - 

***Data analysis*** *(scripts used to perform modeling and statistical analyses with processed data):* 

1. **Relative_CH4Conc_Difference_Analysis.Rmd** - Script to analyze CH4 and CO2 concentration differences among pH treatments at the start and end of the incubation 

## Research questions & Hyoptheses
Q1. What are the key biogeochemical characteristics and processes related to enhanced CH4 oxidation in soils? 
H1. I hypothesize that net soil methanotrophy responds to pH as a threshold effect, likely driven by discrete shifts in microbial community composition and/or enzymatic activity that favors CH4 oxidation over methanogenesis.
